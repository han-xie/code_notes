# code_notes
This repository contains my own notes of code for various purposes.
I also use it to synchronize codes among different devices.

```block

|--01_network_connection.py: check whether network connection is successful
```

[matlab](./matlab)
```block
matlab examples
|--audio_plot.m: plot waveform of audio files (channels splitted)
```
